# Ensure the Server's Private Key Is Protected

1) All private keys must be stored separately from the public certificates. Find all
SSLCertificateFile directives in the Apache configuration files. For any
SSLCertificateFile directives that do not have a corresponding separate
SSLCertificateKeyFile directive, move the key to a separate file from the
certificate, and add the SSLCertificateKeyFile directive for the key file.

2) For each of the SSLCertificateKeyFile directives, change the ownership and
permissions on the server private key to be owned by root:root with permission
0400.
