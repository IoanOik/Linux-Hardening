# Linux Hardening

This project is focused on trying to implement security-driven configurations and techniques in a Linux environment,  
whereas it is on a service level (like a web-server) or the whole operating system itself. The main idea and most of the critical aspects  
of those configurations comes from the Center for Internet Security, a community-driven, nonprofit organization.  

As they constantly release new and improved benchmarks for various Operating Systems and software products, main goal of  
this project is to interpret those guides and create **ready-to-run scripts** in order to automate the overall process, which otherwise can be quite time-consuming.  

For more info about each benchmark and its detailed guidelines, as well as for those techniques that is considered better to be  
**manually implemented**, you may visit the [CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) website.
